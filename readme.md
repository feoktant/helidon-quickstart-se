# helidon-quickstart-se

Sample Helidon SE project that includes multiple REST operations, 
**translated to Scala!**

## Build and run

With JDK21
```bash
sbt package
java -jar target/scala-3.6.3/helidon-quickstart-se.jar
```

TODO: code up is not working for now. Need to copy `lib` folder and `Class-Path`
in `MANIFEST.MF`.
